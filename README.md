# Development of a Causal Model for Improving Rural Seniors’ Accessibility: Data Evidences
## Abstract
Seniors residing in rural areas often encounter limited accessibility to opportunities, resources, and services. This paper introduces a model proposing that both aging and rural residency are factors contributing to the restricted accessibility faced by rural seniors. Leveraging data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, the study examines three hypotheses pertaining to this causal model. Multiple causal pathways emerge in the data analysis, with mobility identified as a mediator in one of them. The study further identifies specific challenges faced by rural seniors, such as the reduced accessibility in reaching medical services and assisting others. These challenges stem primarily from aging and geographic obstacles that not only diminish their willingness to travel but also restrict more in the group from choosing transportation modes with higher mobility. The insights gained from this study serve as a foundation for devising effective methods to enhance transportation accessibility for seniors in rural areas.

H1: Rural seniors’ accessibility is directly impacted by their inherently altered needs for accessing opportunities, resources, and services, as well as their rural residency.
H2: Reduced mobility among rural seniors stems from their constrained choices of travel modes and decreased travel willingness.
H3: The reduced mobility among rural seniors is another reason that rural seniors experience reduced accessibility.
